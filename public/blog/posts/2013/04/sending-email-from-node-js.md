> Super brief introduction to e-mail technologies
> -----------------------------------------------
>
> There are several ways to send an e-mail but in the end it all comes
> down to the SMTP protocol ([Simple Mail Transfer
> Protocol](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Mail_Transfer_Protocol)),
> since this is the method how e-mails are actually transferred in the
> interwebs. There have been some other propositions as well in the
> past, like ISO standardized X.400 for example but these never took off
> and thus don’t really matter for most.
>
> The reason why you don’t just open a TCP connection to the recipients
> incoming SMTP server (the one that is found from the domains DNS MX
> record and listening on port 25), transmit the message and be done
> with it, is that in this way, most probably, your message ends up in
> the junk folder or gets lost entirely - for one, you are not a trusted
> sender, your sending volumes are way too low (what an irony). This
> behaviour is also not optimal, as your application would have to
> handle e-mail bounces, errors, greylisting etc. The better way instead
> is to turn to your Mail Submission Agent (MSA), which also speaks SMTP
> and for an exchange of your credentials, happily queues your message
> for delivery by a relaying Mail Transfer Agent (MTA), which in turn,
> also speaks SMTP. Often MSA and MTA are one and the same but in theory
> they are meant to perform somewhat different tasks.
>
> SMTP is a textual protocol and looks a bit like this:
>
>     CLIENT: <initiates connection to the server>
>     SERVER: 220 bob the mailcat listening
>     CLIENT: HELO joe.the.sender
>     SERVER: 250 Hello, joe.the.sender, nice to meet you!
>     CLIENT: MAIL FROM:<me@example.com>
>     SERVER: 250 Ok, proceed with recipients
>     ...
>
> > The numbers returned from the server are status codes, anything
> > equal or above 400 is an error (HTTP anyone?)
>
> While SMTP defines the transport of the envelope (from the sender’s
> computer to the recipients inboxes), the contents of the envelope is a
> completely different thing. Actually the two are so unrelated, you can
> set whatever you want to as the message contents (you can spoof “from”
> and “to” addresses in the mail header, you can set a future or
> prehistoric date for the message, you can use strange byte sequences
> or use an invalid format etc.) and it still gets delivered. Depending
> on the MSA, some of the data might be corrected though (eg. the
> prehistoric date of yours might be adjusted to a more recent value)
> but not all of it.
>
> It’s exactly as with regular mail - you have an envelope that says
> where the letter is supposed end up and then you have the envelope
> contents that can contain a valid letter, addressed to the same person
> labeled on the envelope; or some money without an explanation; or some
> barb wire; or instead a letter addressed someone totally unrelated
> from the person on the label of the envelope. If you don’t have the
> envelope you can never be sure just based on the included letter from
> where the message originates and to whom it was sent.
>
> Thats why when you look at a spam mail you often see that the
> recipient name and address fields are blank or invalid - the e-mail
> client program takes this information from the message contents and
> not from the envelope. Luckily most servers prepend some of the
> envelope information also to the mail header, so if you look at the
> raw source of the message, the first line, “Delivered-To” says which
> actual address was the final receiver. With several mail accounts
> ending up in the same e-mail client box, you might not be always able
> to tell it by yourself. That is also how BCC works - the name is on
> the envelope but not in the message.

> --------------
>
> To keep you away from the tedious task of mingling together standard

> for Node.js, there’s
> [Nodemailer](https://github.com/andris9/Nodemailer) by yours truly or
> [emailjs](https://github.com/eleith/emailjs) by eleith. These, of

> [node\_mailer](https://github.com/Marak/node_mailer) by Marak Squires

> would definitely suggest using either Nodemailer or emailjs. As the

> these are still worth checking out.
>
> Installing Nodemailer
> ---------------------
>
> Installing Nodemailer follows the common path - you can install it
> from npm. Add a dependency to your package.json and run `npm install`
>
> package.json contents:
>
>     ...
>     "dependencies": {
>        "nodemailer": "0.3.29"
>     },
>     ...
>
> **NB!** If you don’t have a package file yet, you can create one
> automatically by running `npm init`.
>
> Now update your installation by running in the same directory the
> package.json resides.
>
>     npm install
>
> > If you are on Windows, you are going to see some error messages
> > flying through while installing but this is normal and doesn’t
> > affect how the module is going to work in the end. Nodemailer tries
> > to drag [iconv module](https://github.com/bnoordhuis/node-iconv) to
> > the party as an optional dependency and iconv needs compiling. The
> > iconv module isn’t even used, since all the output and input strings
> > for Nodemailer are always in UTF-8. I just haven’t found a good way
> > to automatically exclude the iconv module since the other modules
> > that share the same codebase (eg.
> > [MailParser](https://github.com/andris9/mailparser)) do need it.
>
> And as the last part of the installation equation, include Nodemailer
> in your script file
>
>     var nodemailer = require("nodemailer");
>
> Selecting mail transport method
> -------------------------------
>
> While SMTP makes up the barebones of e-mail messaging, you don’t
> actually have to use it directly if your MSA accepts something else,
> for example HTTP POST request with e-mail file etc. Nodemailer
> includes 3 different mail transports and if this doesn’t suit you, you
> are welcomed to add your own.
>
> 1.  **SMTP** (obviously)
> 2.  **sendmail** to stream message contents to the stdin of `sendmail`
>     command
> 3.  **SES** to post the message contents to Amazon SES REST API
>     endpoint (SES also exposes SMTP endpoint but the used credentials
>     are different in this case, see SES docs for details)
>
> In this article we only look at using SMTP as it is the most important
> of them all.
>
> Setting up SMTP
> ---------------
>
> To use SMTP you need to have access to a MSA server. If you have a
> Gmail or Google Apps account, you can use Gmail SMTP for this but you
> can’t ride it far as there are strict usage limits (about 100 emails
> per day, unless you have a Google Apps Business account that has
> [higher
> limits](https://support.google.com/a/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=166852)),
> besides you can only send mail *from* the same user you are
> authenticated as, you can’t change it to something else (actually you
> can change the address but it is displayed as a nasty “via
> authenticated.user@gmail.com” address, not good for your business if
> you want it to show just “billing@mycompany.com” instead). If you need
> to go any further, consider using [Sendgrid](http://sendgrid.com/) or
> [Postmark](http://postmarkapp.com/) or
> [Mailgun](http://www.mailgun.com/) or Amazon SES or any other
> professional message delivery service. There’s a great discussion in
> Quora about the [reasons behind
> pricing](http://www.quora.com/Why-are-Mailgun-and-Postmark-so-much-more-expensive-than-Sendgrid-and-AWS-SES)
> of these services. If you don’t want to send hundreds of millions
> messages, it is usually more feasible to pay one of the providers than
> building your own e-mail infrastructure. But getting started is
> totally free - you can use Gmail as a starting point and move on to a
> free trial or a developer account of another service before you need
> to pay a cent.
>
> Lets say that for a starters you’re going to use Gmail as the SMTP
> service. Setting up Nodemailer is a piece of cake in this case, you
> just need to have your username and password available:
>
>     var smtpTransport = nodemailer.createTransport("SMTP",{
>        service: "Gmail",
>        auth: {
>            user: "gmail.user@gmail.com",
>            pass: "gmailpass"
>        }
>     });
>
> And that’s it, you now have a working wire for transmitting e-mails.
>
> **NB!** If your mail configuration needs go beyond Gmail, you can find
> the full spectre of connection settings from the [Nodemailer
> documentation](https://github.com/andris9/Nodemailer#setting-up-a-transport-method).
>
> > The problem with SMTP is that you need to have plaintext passwords
> > available somewhere for the app. In case of Gmail there are actually
> > several other options as well. If you use 2 factor authentication,
> > then you can generate application specific password for your mailing
> > app without compromising your real password. There’s also a way to
> > use OAuth1.0 and OAuth2.0 tokens with Gmail if you want to skip
> > using passwords at all. See [Nodemailer
> > documentation](https://github.com/andris9/Nodemailer#smtp-xoauth-and-token-generation)
> > for details.
>
> Sending an e-mail
> -----------------
>
> Now that we have the working wire, we can start sending e-mails. The
> simplest form of e-mail requires sender address, recipients address,
> subject line and message text which can be formatted like this:
>
>     var mailOptions = {
>        from: "me@example.com", // sender address
>        to: "you@example.com", // list of receivers
>        subject: "Hello ✔", // Subject line
>        text: "Hello world ✔" // plaintext body
>     }
>
> If the e-mail structure has been composed, we can send the mail using
> the “transport wire” defined earlier
>
>     smtpTransport.sendMail(mailOptions, function(error, response){
>        if(error){
>            console.log(error);
>        }else{
>            console.log("Message sent: " + response.message);
>        }
>     });
>
> > Nodemailer transport object accepts a large number of messages to be
> > sent at once, you don’t have to wait for the first message to be
> > delivered before you can proceed to the following. Only a limited
> > count of connections are opened to the SMTP server (Nodemailer uses
> > built-in connection pooling) at once and messages are queued
> > automatically for delivery. Thus you can initiate `sendMail` just as
> > well from a `for` loop, no need for a complex async setup or a
> > callback hell.
>
>     for(var i=0; i<mailArray.length; i++){
>        smtpTransport.sendMail(mailArray[i]);
>     }
>
> ### Address formatting
>
> Usually you want to include the name of the sender or receiver in
> addition to the plain address, or sometimes you want to send the
> e-mail to not just one but several recipients. Nodemailer recipient
> fields (“to”, “cc”, “bcc”) accept comma separated addresses for
> multiple recipients and the name can be formatted as well (remeber to
> enclose the name in double quotes if it contains a comma).
>
>     ...,
>     from: "\"Name, User\" <user.name@gmail.com>",
>     to: "Receiver Name <receiver@gmail.com>, plain@example.com, \"Name, Another\" <another@gmail.com>"
>     ...
>
> And as with any other field, unicode is allowed - you can use
> non-ascii characters both for the names and for the domains, unicode
> e-mail domains are converted to the punycode form automatically.
>
> Advanced options
> ----------------
>
> Nodemailer supports a lot of advanced options, like DKIM signing or
> OAuth2.0 token generation and we are not going to cover all of these
> here, see [Nodemailer docs](https://github.com/andris9/Nodemailer)
> instead for all the details about these features.
>
> ### Using HTML and plaintext views
>
> Usually the e-mail contains either HTML view (usually the default),
> plain text view or both. It is a good practice to include plaintext
> view in addition to the HTML view, so the less-able mail clients could
> fall back. Nodemailer can generate the plaintext view automatically,
> based on the HTML view but you can create it yourself if you want to
> (or skip it altogether, as only plaintext capable clients are pretty
> rare nowadays).
>
> You can use both html and text views by specifying according
> properties of the e-mail object.
>
>     ...,
>     text: "plaintext contents",
>     html: "<p>HTML contents</p>",
>     ...
>
> > Keep in mind that one of the main differences between text and html
> > views is that newlines are ignored in the html view but not in the
> > plaintext view when rendering the contents.
>
> You can generate the text view automatically when using
> `generateTextFromHTML` property
>
>     ...,
>     html: "<p>HTML contents</p>",
>     generateTextFromHTML: true,
>     ...
>
> Or if you don’t want to include the text contents at all, use only
> html property
>
>     ...,
>     html: "<p>HTML contents</p>",
>     ...
>
> > Just whatever you do, do not use a plaintext view that only states
> > “Your e-mail client is not capable of displaying this e-mail” - a
> > lot of e-mail clients use the plaintext part (if it exists) as the
> > preview for the message and html part for the actual viewing.
>
> ### Adding attachments
>
> Attachments are defined as an array of attached files. You can use a
> variety of data sources for the attachments (files on disk, strings,
> buffers, streams, even web urls) and for these examples we are using
> files on disk. See [Nodemailer
> documentation](https://github.com/andris9/Nodemailer#attachment-fields)
> for the other options.
>
> The most simple form of attachments are file paths on disk. Attachment
> filename and content type are derived automatically in this case
> (although you can override these values if you want to).
>
>     ...,
>     attachments: [
>        {filePath: __dirname + "/attachment1.txt"},
>        {filePath: __dirname + "/attachment2.txt"}
>     ],
>     ...
>
> When using images as attachments, you can point to these images as
> embedded files for the HTML view. You need to define unique `cid`
> value for the attachment and use it as an URL.
>
>     ...,
>     html: "<p>Embedded image: <img src='cid:image1'/></p>",
>     attachments:[
>        {filePath: __dirname + "/image1.jpg", cid: "image1"}
>     ],
>     ...
>
> In conclusion
> -------------
>
> Using an e-mail library like Nodemailer makes your life so much easier
> if you want to send an e-mail with Node.js. Sure, you can compose the
> message by yourself and transmit it using the standard Node.js `net`
> module (and if you’re really interested how the e-mail system works,
> then this is exactly the way you’re going to do it) but most probably
> you just need to send an e-mail to your customer and you don’t really
> care how it is delivered, as long as it makes it through and displays
> as intended.
>
> If you want to bring your e-mail related application to the next
> level, you could also start receiving and parsing e-mail in addition
> to sending it. For creating your own SMTP MX server for accepting
> e-mail from the interwebs, you can use simpler
> [SimpleSMTP](https://github.com/andris9/simplesmtp#smtp-server) by
> yours truly or full featured [Haraka](http://haraka.github.com/) by
> baudehlo which is able to fight against spam as well. If you do not
> want to manage message exchange server by yourself but to use IMAP for
> connecting to an existing one, you can use
> [node-imap](https://github.com/mscdex/node-imap) by mscdex or
> [inbox](https://github.com/andris9/inbox). Once you have received the
> e-mail (either through SMTP or IMAP), you can parse the raw source
> into a structurized object wih
> [MailParser](https://github.com/andris9/mailparser). I have also
> created a helper module
> [mailuploader](https://github.com/andris9/mailuploader) to parse an
> e-mail raw source and post the parsed object to a HTTP address as a
> regular *multipart/form-data* upload, so even a PHP script could
> easily handle it.
>
> I hope that by reading this article you found out how easy it is to
> send e-mails using Nodemailer. And if you ever run into trouble with
> it, then you know where you can [file an
> issue](https://github.com/andris9/Nodemailer/issues).
