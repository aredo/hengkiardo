title: Learning from life today 
-->


A players hire A players because they like working with other really
talented people. B players hire C players because they are threatened by
anyone who knows more or is smarter than they are. C players think they
are just as good as A or B players.

A players are creative and talented and work really hard.

B players are usually not creative, but might work fairly hard.

C players could be totally lazy, or could just be newbs.
