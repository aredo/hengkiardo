title: Dear User: Please Upgrade Your Browser
-->


Shopping. Social networking. Emailing. Reading. Finding directions.
Banking. Researching. Those are some of the most common tasks people
perform on the World Wide Web. You’ve probably done all of these things
yourself at some point. So if you’re like many people, you probably do
these things every single week (and many of them even every day).

### Your Browser Is Too Old

Everyone that accesses Web pages on a desktop computer uses a Web
browser. Without a Web browser you cannot view or interact with
websites. How do you personally access websites like Facebook and
YouTube? You might commonly use the program that opens when you click
the big blue “e” icon on your desktop. Here’s what it looks like:

*This is the logo for Internet Explorer, a Web browser.*

This “e” icon is not a shortcut to a generic “internet” or “Web”
program. It is a shortcut to a Web browser made by Microsoft, called
“Internet Explorer” (also referred to as “IE”). Over the past 17 years,
this browser has been the most popular Web browser. At one time, it was
arguably the best browser you could use. But that is not true anymore.

Internet Explorer is currently at version 9, and version 10 is supposed
to be officially released some time this year. But most people are not
using IE9—most Web users that use Microsoft’s browser are still using a
less stable, insecure, slow version of IE (either IE8 or something
older).

The truth is, even IE9 (which is a huge improvement over previous
versions of Internet Explorer) is not as up-to-date as other browsers.
So if you’re still using some version of Internet Explorer, ***we
strongly recommend that you upgrade to a different browser. To help you
upgrade***, we have some options for you to consider. But before we
introduce those other browsers to you, let’s quickly cover some reasons
why older browsers like IE7 and IE8 aren’t as good.

### What’s Wrong With Old Browsers?

Old browsers (especially Internet Explorer versions 6, 7, and 8) are
less stable, and much more vulnerable to viruses, spyware, malware, and
other security issues. Those are obviously big problems to be concerned
about—especially for people who shop online. So security alone is a very
good reason to upgrade. But there’s more to it than that.

Old Browsers Are Slow and More Likely to Crash Firstly

old browsers are very slow. Every Web page that loads in a browser has
to perform a number of different tasks. One of those tasks is the
process of loading different files. These files include images,
programming scripts, and other resources that help improve the look and
functionality of the website you’re visiting. Old browsers do not
perform these tasks with the same speed as new browsers. This makes your
experience on the Web considerably slow, and can sometimes cause your
browser to crash or freeze.

New browsers support new Web technologies (like HTML5 and CSS3). These
languages serve as a foundation for many websites today, and for
virtually all new websites and Web apps. But unfortunately, many of
these new websites will neither look nor function in the same way in old
browsers like IE8

**New Browser Options**

Now that you understand why it’s highly recommended to upgrade an old
browser, let’s take a look at what options you have for a new browser,
and what strengths these browsers have. Please notice that switching to
one of these browsers is free and won’t take more than a couple of
minutes.

[Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome)

In May 2012, according to at least one statistics website, Google Chrome
(all versions combined) became the most popular browser in the world
(compared to IE, all versions combined). Chrome was first released in
2008, and has a number of advantages over old browsers like IE8.

[Mozilla Firefox](http://getfirefox.com/)

Firefox has been the main competitor to Internet Explorer since the
mid-2000′s. Although Google’s Chrome has become more popular in recent
years, Firefox is a great browser with many advantages over old
browsers.

[Opera](http://www.opera.com/)

Compared to other browsers, Opera isn’t used as much, but it has been
around since the mid-90′s. Opera has always been at the forefront of
browser innovation and supports many of the latest technologies and
features that make websites faster and more feature-rich.

[Apple’s Safari](http://www.apple.com/safari/)

This is the same browser that’s commonly used on iPhones and iPads.
Safari’s features are very similar to Google’s Chrome, and has been
around since 2003.

Why Are New Browsers Better?

The browsers listed above have a number of advantages over older
browsers, including:

-   Far fewer instances of crashing or freezing. 
-   Much more secure from virus, malware, and browser hijacking
    attacks. 
-   Much faster page-loading.
-   Larger page-viewing area.
-   A large variety of useful optional plugins and add-ons that add
    extra features to improve Web browsing. 
-   Unlike IE9 and the upcoming IE10, they can be installed on Windows
    XP. 
-   New browsers will automatically update to the latest version, or
    will notify you to download an update. 

### About Automatic Updating

The last point in the list above mentions the fact that new browsers
will automatically notify you of an update—this is a good thing. When
you have a browser that’s kept up-to-date automatically, you get a
number of important benefits in addition to those already mentioned.
These include:

You’ll rarely, if ever, come across a website that says “your browser
cannot view this website”. If any known security vulnerabilities are
present, they will be fixed automatically. Every time your browser is
upgraded, your browser becomes faster, meaning that the time you spend
waiting for pages to load will be minimal. Old browsers like IE7 and IE8
will not automatically notify you to update, so if you continue to use
an old browser, your experience on the Web will become less secure (and
less enjoyable as the months go by).

### Conclusion

There are countless reasons to upgrade your old browser and start using
something new and up-to-date. So trust us when we say that your
experience on the Web will be infinitely better if you choose to do
this.

Whatever you’re doing on the Web—reading email, shopping, banking, or
anything else—a new browser will allow your experience to be safer,
faster, and much more beautiful.
