title: Prevent pinning pictures from your site to Pinterest
-->


**Pinterest** is the fastest growing sharing platform today, but has its
own problems. It is the heaven of copyright violations and similar.

For example, if you are a photographer and have a bunch of your photos
available online on your site, people will surely pin some of them.
Then, other people will see those images on Pinetrest, download them and
use somewhere, thus violating your copyright. Some people will even
name *Pinterest* as the source of the image!

People at Pinterest are aware of it and released a small trick to
disallow pictures from your site to be pinned.

Actually, it’s a meta tag that prevents the pinning to Pinterest.

Just place somewhere between and in your sites header:

\<meta name=”pinterest” content=”nopin” /\>

Now, if anyone tries to pin an image to Pinterest, they will receive an
alert :

> This site doesn’t allow pinning to Pinterest. Contact website owner
> for any questions.

Handy.
