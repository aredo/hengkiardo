title: Gmail Users Now Can Send 10GB Files

Gmail announced Tuesday that it will be integrating [Google
Drive](http://mashable.com/follow/topics/google-drive/) into Gmail, a
move that will make it possible to send files up to a massive 10GB in
size over email.

A new button in the Gmail compose window will give users the ability to
attach a file from their Google Drive account rather than attaching the
file itself to the message.

Once it’s attached, Gmail will ensure that your recipient has permission
to view the file in your Drive account -– or will prompt you to grant
that permission –- and then sends the message.

The feature works not only for files you attach to the message, but also
for links to items stored in Google Drive you might paste into a
message.
