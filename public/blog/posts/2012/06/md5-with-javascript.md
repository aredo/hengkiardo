MD5 Message-Digest Algorithm is a widely used cryptographic hash
function that produces a 128-bit (16-byte) hash value.

This script is used to process a variable length message into a
fixed-length output of 128 bits using the MD5 algorithm. It is fully
compatible with UTF-8 encoding. It is very useful when u want to
transfer encrypted passwords over the internet. If you plan using UTF-8
encoding in your project donâ€™t forget to set the page encoding to UTF-8
(Content-Type meta tag).
