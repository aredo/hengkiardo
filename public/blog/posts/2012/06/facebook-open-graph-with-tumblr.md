With the Facebook Open Graph, you can define actions and objects in the
meta data of a web page. When an action is issued by a Facebook user, a
request is made to the Graph API endpoint:
`/me/action:object=ObjectURL`, Facebook will crawl the webpage specified
at `Object URL` and parse the meta data related to that page. The data
is represented in the news feed as: “John Smith [action] [object]” or
“John Smith [ate] [a shoe]”.
